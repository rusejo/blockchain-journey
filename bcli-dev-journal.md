## Development process: journey

### Setting the base app.
First, I had to follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhDBbbMJWoY) to create a prototype of a command line interface (CLI) using Electron and Xterm. In the project folder, I had to install some npm packages, like:

```
npm i electron
npm i electron-tools
npm i node-pty xterm 
```
As the code giving me the error due to VB compiler, the same way as in the tutorial, also I had to install `npm i electron-rebuild` and rebuild the electron package to be able to run the app. All of this was hard because I had some dependencies version failures. Even I had to test it also on Linux to figure out the problem.

### Parse the CLI arguments
Once the app is running, the first challenge to resolve is how can I parse the command arguments that I introduce in order to sending them after to a blockchained process? We just need the commands, not all the printed ones that we get as soon as we type on it.

It needs first capture on Javascript the event of the enter action and then use ipc method to comunicate this action between the rendered file and the process file. As the command line takes each of the keystrokes that we introduce as a character, I need to capture it when I hit enter, save it on a variable and sending it into the blockchained process; then clear the variable content to start over again each time. 

The following code resumes all of this:

On `index.js`

``` javascript
//Variable to concatenate the keystrokes of the command
var command = "";
var term = new Terminal();
term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));

//Send command string to the Blockchained process
var input = document.getElementById("terminal");
input.addEventListener("keyup", function (event, data) {
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
        ipc.send('terminal.command', command);
        //Clean the command variable
        command = "";
    }
});
```

On `main.js`
``` javascript
//Recive command from terminal
    var ipc = require('electron').ipcMain;
    ipc.on('terminal.command', function (event, data) {
        //Further actions
    });
```

### Enhacing bCLI as a REST API

Ok. By now a I can get the commands, but how can be used. The basic blockchain code uses POST and GET operations to manage the information. So, in order to integrate the CLI with the blockchain code, I need to turn the app in a REST API backend. I've read [this article](https://medium.com/@keshavagrawal/electron-js-react-js-express-js-b0fb2aa8233f) to get the explanation of how to do it on my proyect, and followed up [this tutorial](https://expressjs.com/es/starter/hello-world.html) to achieve on it.

First, on the project, we need to install `npm i express --save`, to save it as a dependecy.

Create a `app.js` to act a a server:

``` javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```
Then create the file `renderer.js` to spawn the server on `app.js`

``` javascript
let server = require('./app');
```
And finally, on `index.html` load the previous file.

``` HTML
<script src="./renderer.js"></script>
```

By doing this, when I execute the bCLI, the express server will be loaded simultaneously with the app. Back-end and front-end ready!

### Handling HTTP methods and responses (GET and POST).

In order to request HTTP calls to send nd recieve information, as the Blockchain code does, we need to establish that communication channel between the `main.js` and de `app.js` or where the calls will be. For that purpose, we need the [axios library](https://nodejs.dev/learn/make-an-http-post-request-using-nodejs) by installing `npm i axios`.

Then, right after we recieve the command from the prompt, on `main.js` add:

``` javascript
//POST or GET Request
        axios
            .post/get('URL', {
                command: data
            })
            .then(res => {
                console.log(res);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error(error)
            })
```

In order to diplay the proper information passed through the POST method, on the `app.js`, we need to include a body parser `app.use(express.json());`, and get the responde by `req.body.command`.

### Setting up the server

In order to use the blockchain structure, we need to have a server up on a certain point (by now). To achieve that, we installed `npm i nodemon` and configure the `package.json` to be able to be ready. We add the following line to rthe scripts section of the file:

```javascript
"server":"app.js 3001 http://localhost:3001",
```
So, with that, we need to run first `npm run server` and after excecute out CLI. Then we'll have everything to proceed to the next part.

### bCLI Blockchain structure

To the prototype of Blockchain, we add the command data on it.

```javascript
Blockchain.prototype.createNewBlock = function (nonce, previousBlockHash, hash, command) {
    //Constants variables
    const newBlock = {
        index: this.chain.length + 1, //What block is this in out chain.
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        transactions: this.pendingTransactions, //All of the transactions on this block.
        nonce: nonce, //Unique number (only used once). Proof that we actually create a legit block.
        hash: hash, //The data from our new block.
        previousBlockHash: previousBlockHash, //Data from our current block hashed into a string
        //The OS command
        command: command
    };

    this.pendingTransactions = []; //Clears out any pendingTransactions
    this.chain.push(newBlock); //Add the newBlock to the chain.

    return newBlock;
}
```

And update its methods in order to use it, like:

```Javascript
Blockchain.prototype.createNewTransaction = function (amount, sender, recipient, command) {
    const newTransaction = {
        //Create a new transaction object
        amount: amount,
        sender: sender,
        recipient: recipient,
        command:command,
        transactionId: uuidv4().split('-').join('')
    };
    return newTransaction;
    //Save data into the transactions array.
   // this.pendingTransactions.push(newTransaction);
   // return this.getLastBlock()['index'] + 1; //Get the index of the last block of out chain plus one for a new block
}
```
On `app.js`, we add all the Blockchain API calls. Now, in order to use it, right after `main.js` catches the comand from the renderer, we collect the data and send it to the API call:

```javascript
//Recive command from terminal
    var ipc = require('electron').ipcMain;
    ipc.on('terminal.command', function (event, data) {
        const blockData = [{
            "amount": 1,
            "sender": "localhost.com",
            "recipient": "server.com",
            "command": data
        }];
        //Add a transaction
        axios
            .post('http://localhost:3000/transaction', {
                command: blockData
            })
            .then(res => {
                console.log(res);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error(error)
            });
            //Mine the transaction
            axios
            .get('http://localhost:3000/mine', {
            })
            .then(res => {
                console.log(res);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error(error)
            })
        console.log(bcli);
    });
```

### Multiple bCLI instances.

This was the hardest part of the project. The idea was simple: run multiple applications, each listening to its own server. Up to this point we already have Express installed, and with nodemon running, we can pull up as many servers as we want along with their ports. However, we have only one electron application. What we need are several instances of that application running on different servers, each on its own port.

For this point, nodemon has a limitation: we can't run both scripts at the same time; either we monitor the server script or the application script. However, we need nodemon to monitor the server script because that is where it gets the port. The solution was not easy.

The solution found is a module that performs the same process but for applications made in Electron. With this, it is possible to raise a service at the same time that the application is running. So, we installed `npm i electron-connect`. Once installed, the client will be the main application process, in `main.js`, and the server in `app.js`. In each of them, we add the instructions to run as such. 

On `main.js`, we need to run rhe client once the app is ready. 

```javascript
app.on("ready", function(){
    createWindow();
    client.create(mainWindow);
});
```

On `app.js`, add the server instruction:

```javascript
var electron = require('electron-connect').server.create();
```

#### The 'Port communication problem'.

So far, when we run the application with nodemon, it wakes up and automatically creates a service listening to the client on a certain process port thanks to the electron-connect module. But if we try to run another instance, we get an error, because the port is occupied by the first instance. You would think that you could dynamically add the ports by taking them from the nodemon command argument and specifying them in the client and server instructions. This is possible in `app.js`, but not for `main.js`, because we are using nodemon within the first script.

The application architecture does not facilitate communication between the process and the server, as it is limited by the application architecture, even when using socket communication or global variables. To solve this problem, the viable solution would be to obtain the listening port through GET requests to the server from the main process and once there assign them to the corresponding instructions. 

As we want this request to be separate from the Blockchain process requests, we need to create a small server extension from the original that listens on a specific port (different from the one indicated in nodemon). Therefore, in `app.js`, we add: 

``` javascript
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(8080, function () {
    console.log("Port information service")
});
```
And on `main.js`, when the app is launched:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
    http.get('http://localhost:8080/port',(res)=>{
        res.on('data',(d)=>{
           puertoServidor = d.toString('utf8');
        })
    })
```

As we have already obtained the port, it only remains to place it in its respective locations. In order to be dynamic and not to be repeated in the instances, we will add five to the port number received from the argument, being a different one each time it is executed. 

On `main.js`, we add the client port

```javascript
const http = require('http');
    http.get('http://localhost:8080/port',(res)=>{
        res.on('data',(d)=>{
           puertoServidor = d.toString('utf8');
        })
    })
    client.create(mainWindow, {port:parseInt(puertoServidor)+5});
```

On `app.js`, add the server port

```javascript
var electron = require('electron-connect').server.create({port:parseInt(puertoServidor)+5});
```

With these instructions, we can now tell the electron-connect service to run on a different port each time another instance of the application is launched. 

However, now we face the same port traffic problem but in the small server we created for the communication between the process and the server: if two instances are executed, the second one will not be able to get the port information because the first one is occupying the port. What we need is that once the execution of an instance is started and the request is launched, the process receives that data, and the server, after a certain time, closes the connection and releases the port, thus allowing another instance to be executed and can occupy the port to request the information. 

For this, a timer was added to control the service. After 10 seconds of execution, it closes. This is added on the request part on the server `app.js`:

```javascript
app.get('/port', (req, res) => {
    res.send(port);
    
    (function countDown(counter) {
        while (counter > 0) {
            console.log(counter)
            return setTimeout(countDown, 1000, counter - 1)
        }server.close();
        })(10);
});
```
With the latter, and with its limitations, we can finally run as many instances as we specify using nodemon commands. 

### Broadcast a transaction.

What we want is that, once the application is launched, it connects to the network of the other available terminals. To do this, we add in an array with the available terminals (in the future, the list can be consulted directly from the system files, for example, in UNIX/Linux OS, from the `/etc/hosts` file) and iterate the reigistration with the network members excluding itself. We do this on the process file `main.js`, when the app is ready, at the same time when we get the port information from the server file.

```javascript
//Register on a network at launch

            var fullNetwork = [3000,3001];
            var currentNetwork = fullNetwork.filter(function(x){return x !== parseInt(puertoServidor)})
            for (let networkNode of currentNetwork) {
                axios
                    .post(`http://localhost:${puertoServidor}/register-node`,
                        { "newNodeUrl": "http://localhost:" + networkNode },
                        {})
                    .then(res => {
                        console.log("tty registered")
                    })
                    .catch(error => {
                        console.error("error")
                    });
            }
```

Then, when the application is up, we access a GET request with axios to make the connections with the network members. With the latter, everything we do and the transactions/commands we execute inside the terminal will be registered in the chain and sent to all the members of the network that are connected.
